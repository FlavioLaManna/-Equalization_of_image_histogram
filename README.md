# Equalization_of_image_histogram
Logical networks course project - Politecnico di Milano 2021

Programming language: VHDL

The objective of the project is implementing a simplified version of the equalization method for an image histogram. In order to do this, I developed a component that, with certain input and output signals, can equalize consecutive images with maximum 128x128 pixels. The detailed description of the component, the idea of the solution, the projectual choices and the results can be found in report.pdf. Also there are some test benches to try the component. Unfortunately the language is italian.
